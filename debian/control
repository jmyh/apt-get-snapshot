Description: Download a specific version of a debian package from snapshot.debian.org
  apt-get-snapshot is a command-line tool that downloads a specific version of
  a debian package from snapshot.debian.org.
  .
  When using debian testing, it is not trivial to get the previous version of a
  package after it is upgraded. snapshot.debian.org is the source to go for these
  cases, but it has only a web interface. apt-get-snapshot navigates that web
  interface and fetches the desired package.
